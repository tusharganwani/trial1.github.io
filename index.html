All of us at some point of time feel that compliance under various laws (particularly under GST laws) is becoming increasingly difficult due to certain provisions some of which are not only irrational and very much difficult to comply but also a deterrent to the growth of our businesses or at times appears like a challenge to the survival of our business.
<br />
We are sure you too have some of such experiences. We, therefore, request you to kindly let us know about such issues you are having. You may send the same in writing or may inform the same personally or over phone to the under signed or to:

<br />
2) Shri Sandeep Sinhal, Past President and PRO #9434045692, Anil Traders, Sevoke Road, Siliguri

There have been a few incidents of stock verification at some of our dealers premises by SGST authorities in last few days.

In this connection we had a meeting with the Special Commissioner, SGST, Mr Sonam Wangdi Bhutia, IAS, at his office today. We handed over a deputation to him regarding inconvenience and stress it is causing to our members and discussed the issue at length. The special Commissioner informed us that a drive is going on as per directions of the Election Commission to verify the stock of sensitive items. In view of the ensuing Parliament election 2024, Election commission has identified some items as sensitive and the list contains few items dealt in by our members such as Tarpaulin and carry bags.
<br />
Members dealing in such items are requested to please update their stocks and keep the records ready such as stock register, sale and purchase vouchers etc. Also please ensure that all the godowns are reported and appear in the GST certificate.
<br />
The Hon'ble Commissioner has assured that verification will be carried out without undue inconvenience to the dealer. However, if you experience any problem during the verification at your premises, kindly inform us so that matter can be taken up with the department.</p>

Dear Members,<br />

It's been observed that some of our member's are facing problem while transport lengthy goods through Auto van. These goods generally comes out of the Auto Dala and the traffic police stops & Fine them during transit.<br />

To overcome this problem we had a meeting with the traffic police to come at a mutual understanding. Accordingly the members are advised to take care of the following points.<br />

1) Ensure that the lengthy goods do not come out of the Auto Van body by more than 3ft.<br />

2) Cover both end of the goods by proper clothes (Preferably Red) so that the end of the good do not harm any person<br />

Pleas ensure these points for smooth transportation of your goods.</p>
